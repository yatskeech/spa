				This project is a web application developed using <b>React</b>,{' '}
				<b>React Router</b> and <b>Material-UI</b> that allows users to interact
				with user and album data obtained through the <b>JSONPlaceholder API</b>
				. The application provides an intuitive interface to view a list of
				users and their albums.
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph>
				Users can easily find information by selecting a specific user to see
				all of their albums. I tried to create a convenient and effective
				solution for managing and viewing media content, making it accessible to
				everyone.
